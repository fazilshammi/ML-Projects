# 🔄 Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

- To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn.
- To explore and clean the data using pandas and visualization libraries.
- To perform feature engineering and model selection.
- To evaluate model performance using classification metrics.

## 🧪 Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains a complete churn prediction pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The model helps identify customers who are likely to leave a business or service.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling and evaluation

---

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading** – Import customer churn dataset
2. **EDA** – Visualize churn distribution and correlations
3. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values and outliers
4. **Feature Engineering** – Encode categorical features
5. **Model Training** – Train classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
6. **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC

---

## 📈 Example Metrics Used

- Confusion Matrix
- Precision / Recall / F1-score
- ROC Curve and AUC Score

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**, or **VS Code** with Python kernel.
3. Run all cells to see the entire churn prediction process in action.
